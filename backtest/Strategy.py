    Strategy is an abstract base class providing an interface for
    all subsequent (inherited) strategy handling objects.

    The goal of a (derived) Strategy object is to generate Signal
    objects for particular symbols based on the inputs of Bars 
    (OHLCV) generated by a DataHandler object.

    This is designed to work both with historic and live data as
    the Strategy object is agnostic to where the data came from,
    since it obtains the bar tuples from a queue object.
